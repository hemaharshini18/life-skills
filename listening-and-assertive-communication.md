## Q5 When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

I become passive when I don’t want to create conflict, like during group discussions if everyone else strongly disagrees with me. I also stay quiet sometimes when I feel the other person won’t understand or listen.

## Q6 When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

I usually become aggressive when I am very stressed or frustrated, for example if someone keeps interrupting. At those times, I might raise my voice or speak harshly.

## Q7 When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

Sometimes when I feel upset but don’t want to argue directly, I may use sarcasm or stay silent. For example, if a friend cancels plans often, instead of telling them directly, I might joke about it in a sarcastic way.
