## Tiny Habits

### Q1. what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The story of *flossing just one tooth*. It shows that starting really
small makes a habit easy and less scary. Small steps grow into big
changes.

### Q2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

- B = MAP â†’ Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt*
- Motivation: Wanting to do it.
- Ability: How simple it is.
- Prompt: A reminder to act\
To build habits, make them simple and use prompts, because motivation
alone isn't enough.

### Q3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

Because *feelings create habits*. When we celebrate (smile, say "Yes!",
or do a fist pump), our brain feels good and wants to repeat it.

### Q4. Most interesting idea?

Getting *1% better every day adds up to huge growth*. Small wins turn
into big results.

### Q5. Identity perspective?

Focus on *identity-based habits*. Instead of "I want to run a marathon,"
say "I am a runner." Each small action is a vote for the person you want
to become.

### Q6. How to make a habit easier?

- Remove extra steps.
- Use the *2-minute rule* (just start small).
- Automate if possible.

### Q7. How to make a habit harder?
